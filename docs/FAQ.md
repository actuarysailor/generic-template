# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Getting Started

### How do I use this template?

1. Use the `BLANK_README.md` file as your starting point
2. Search and replace the following placeholders with your actual information:
   - `github_username` → your GitHub username
   - `repo_name` → your repository name
   - `project_title` → your project name
   - `project_description` → brief description of your project
   - `project_license` → your chosen license (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.)
   - `twitter_handle` → your Twitter/X handle
   - `linkedin_username` → your LinkedIn username
   - `email_client` → your email provider (e.g., gmail, outlook)
   - `email` → your email address

### What's the difference between README.md and BLANK_README.md?

- **README.md** - Example template showing what the final result looks like
- **BLANK_README.md** - Clean template with placeholders for you to customize

### Do I need to keep both files?

No! Use `BLANK_README.md` as your starting point, customize it, then rename it
to `README.md` for your project. You can delete the original files.

## Customization

### How do I add my own logo?

1. Add your logo image to the `images/` folder
2. Update the logo reference in your README:

   ```markdown
   <img src="images/your-logo.png" alt="Logo" width="80" height="80">
   ```

3. Update the `[product-screenshot]` reference at the bottom if needed

### How do I customize the shields/badges?

The shields are generated by [shields.io](https://shields.io). Update the URLs
at the bottom of the template:

```markdown
[contributors-shield]: https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.svg?style=for-the-badge
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO` with your actual GitHub username and
repository name.

### Can I remove sections I don't need?

Absolutely! The template is designed to be modular. Common sections to remove:

- **Built With** - if not using frameworks
- **Roadmap** - for completed projects
- **LinkedIn badge** - if you prefer not to include social links
- **Table of Contents** - for simpler projects

Just remember to also remove the corresponding links in the Table of Contents.

### How do I add more sections?

Follow the existing pattern:

1. Add your section with proper markdown heading
2. Add a "back to top" link:
   `<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>`
3. Update the Table of Contents with a link to your new section

## Markdown & Formatting

### Why are there HTML tags in a markdown file?

Some features require HTML for proper formatting:

- **Image sizing** - Markdown can't specify width/height
- **Center alignment** - Pure markdown doesn't support centering
- **Collapsible sections** - `<details>` and `<summary>` tags

These are standard and supported by GitHub's markdown renderer.

### Do I need the .markdownlint.json file?

The `.markdownlint.json` file ensures your README follows markdown best
practices. It's optional but recommended for:

- Consistent formatting
- Better readability
- Professional appearance
- Compatibility with markdown tools

### How do I handle long URLs in markdown linting?

The template uses "reference-style" links to keep the content readable:

```markdown
[Link text][reference-name]

<!-- At bottom of file -->
[reference-name]: https://very-long-url-here
```

This keeps the main content clean while satisfying line length requirements.

## Technical Questions

### Can I use this for commercial projects?

Yes! This template is released under the Unlicense, meaning it's in the public
domain. You can use it for any purpose without attribution (though attribution
is appreciated).

### Does this work with GitHub Pages?

Yes! The template is fully compatible with GitHub Pages and will render
correctly.

### Can I translate this to other languages?

Absolutely! You can:

1. Create separate README files (e.g., `README.es.md` for Spanish)
2. Translate section headers and standard text
3. Keep code examples and technical content as-is

### How do I auto-generate README.md from BLANK_README.md?

You can create scripts to:

1. Read `BLANK_README.md`
2. Replace placeholders with actual values
3. Generate the final `README.md`

This is useful for organizations with multiple repositories following the same
pattern.

## Troubleshooting

### My images aren't showing up

Check these common issues:

1. **File path** - Ensure `images/logo.png` exists in your repository
2. **Case sensitivity** - GitHub is case-sensitive (`Logo.png` ≠ `logo.png`)
3. **File format** - Use common formats: PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG

### The shields/badges show errors

Common causes:

1. **Repository not public** - Some shields require public repositories
2. **Incorrect username/repo** - Double-check your GitHub username and
   repository name
3. **Repository too new** - Some metrics need time to populate

### Markdown isn't rendering correctly

1. **Check syntax** - Use a markdown linter or preview
2. **HTML compatibility** - Ensure HTML tags are properly closed
3. **Reference links** - Verify all `[reference]` links have corresponding
   definitions
